# üö® Accident Detection with SOS Alert System

This project is a smart AI-based solution that detects road accidents using video footage and sends an automated SOS alert to emergency contacts using Twilio SMS API. It‚Äôs designed to assist in faster emergency response during real-time traffic incidents captured via CCTV, dashcams, or smartphone cameras.

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/accident-detection-sos.git
cd accident-detection-sos
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
To install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install notebook
üöÄ Running the Project
Step 1: Start Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Step 2: Open and Run the Notebook
Open the file named:
accident_detection_sos.ipynb

Run all the cells step-by-step.

‚ö†Ô∏è Twilio Setup (Important Before Running Last Cell)
Before executing the last cell in the notebook (which sends the SMS), you need to add your Twilio credentials.

Replace the placeholders in the designated cell with your actual credentials:

python
Copy
Edit
# Twilio credentials (use with caution)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = ''      # Add your Twilio Account SID here

TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = ''       # Add your Twilio Auth Token here

TWILIO_SERVICE_SID = ''      # (Optional) Add Service SID if using Verification service

TO_PHONE_NUMBER = ''         # Enter the emergency phone number (with country code)

You can find these details in your Twilio Console.

üìù Notes
The model assumes accident detection is based on predefined patterns or a trained ML model. Ensure the video input is compatible.

This is a prototype for research/academic/demo use and is not certified for real-world emergency services.

Further improvements like GPS data integration, real-time streaming, or audio alerts can be added for deployment-ready systems.
